MoransI_Java
============

I'm working on a java class which calculates Moran's index for spatial autocorrelation. This is part of my thesis project.

Now this part is fully completed. It can compute inverse spatial weights and compute Moran's I index with p-value.
Code is open to anyone.
It uses the platform Processing, which is based on Java. So it's very easily imported to any Java project. Or you can rewrite it in any other languages.
